# Language Liquidator, submission for HackNJIT2020

Visit our domain at languageliquidator.space and select a room number for you and your partner to utilize.

Once in your private room, select your source language (the language you'll be speaking) and your target language (the language you want your words to be translated to).

Make sure to confirm that your selected languages are correct as you won't be able to change them unless you leave the room and join another.
